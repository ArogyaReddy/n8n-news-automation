## 🚀 **Railway Should Now Deploy Successfully**

### **What to Expect:**
1. **Auto-redeploy** triggered by GitHub push
2. **Build process** will use new Dockerfile
3. **n8n will start** on Railway's assigned port
4. **Status should change** from CRASHED to ACTIVE

### **If Still Crashing:**
1. **Check Railway logs**: Click "View logs" in Railway
2. **Try manual restart**: Click "Restart" button
3. **Alternative**: We can switch to Render.com (equally free)

## 📋 **Next Steps After Successful Deploy:**

1. **Get your Railway URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. **Access n8n** in browser
3. **No login required** (auth disabled for simplicity)
4. **Import workflow** from `daily-news-workflow.json`
5. **Add NewsAPI key** and configure delivery
