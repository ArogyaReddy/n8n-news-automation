âœ… **Better Docker support** - No caching issues  
âœ… **Clearer build process** - See exactly what's happening  
âœ… **More reliable free tier** - Designed for Docker  
âœ… **Automatic HTTPS** - Secure by default

## ðŸ“‹ **Alternative: Completely Local Setup**

If you want to test locally first:

```bash
# In your terminal:
cd /Users/arog/n8n
docker build -t n8n-local .
docker run -p 5678:5678 n8n-local
```

Then access: `http://localhost:5678`

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation:**

**Use Render.com** - It's specifically designed for this type of deployment and has much better Docker support than Railway.

**Ready to try Render?** It should work immediately! ðŸš€
